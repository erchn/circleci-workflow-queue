  Allows jobs or entire workflows to be queued to ensure they run in serial.
  This is ideal for deployments or other activities that must not run concurrently.
  May optionaly consider branch-level isolation if unique branches should run concurrently.
  This orb requires the project to have an CircleCI API key in order to query build states.
